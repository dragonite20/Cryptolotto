# CryptoLotto

Our prototype is similar to a jackpot game. Using Hashing power of several computers and our code base, we create a jackpot and every week we draw the lucky winner of the pot. People can run a miner on any web browser using any devices in order to get a ticket to the lottery draw Our algorithm is built for CPU mining! It relies on random access to a slow memory and emphasizes latency dependence. The magic behind that it fits in the L3 cache (per core) of modern processors, which should become mainstream in a few years we hope to launch it soon.
